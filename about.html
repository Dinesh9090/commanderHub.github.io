    <p class="py-3">Garena Free Fire is all prepared to undergo an update tomorrow on 4th August. This update will witness a few additions being made to the gameplay side of things like a new 1v1 game mode, a new map, changes to the squad mode, and a number of new special weapon attachments. All this is coming on top of the already released 'Wildland Walkers - Elite Pass S39' which is scheduled to run from 1st to 31st August. While Free Fire is being updated tomorrow, the game will be unavailable to all the players for about eight hours.</p>
